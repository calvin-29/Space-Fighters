Sorry there is no code to use usb controllers only ps3 contollers
But you can use your keyboard instead
The controller can only be used on single player mode
In Two player mode:
  Player 2:
    Left - To move left
    Right - To move right
    Up - To move up
    Down - To move down
    Right-Ctrl - To shoot
  Player 1:
    A - To move left
    D - To move right
    W - To move up
    S - To move down
    Left-Ctrl - To shoot
